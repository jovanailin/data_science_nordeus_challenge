# data_science_nordeus_challenge

Welcome to my repository for the Nordeus Data Science Challenge. This project is an exploration into predicting league ranks using various machine learning models.

## Repository Contents
- Nordeus Data Science Challenge.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all the exploratory data analysis, model building, and predictions.
- jobfair_test.csv: The test dataset for the challenge.
- jobfair_train.csv: The training dataset used to build the model.
- predictions.csv: The output file with the predicted league ranks.

## Challenge Overview
This challenge involves predicting league ranks with the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection and prediction.

## Models Explored
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear and Ridge Regression

## Installation and Running the Notebook
To run the notebook, ensure you have Jupyter installed and simply open the Nordeus `Data Science Challenge.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment.
